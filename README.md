# OpenClaw Skill Creator

> Teach your OpenClaw agent new tricks by creating custom skills. Use when you want your agent to do something it can't do yet — like "read my Google Calendar", "send Slack messages", "analyze my CSV files", or "search my company docs". Even if you just say "I wish my agent could do X", this skill helps you build it. No coding experience needed — just describe what you want in plain English. allowed-tools: - Read - Write - Bash(curl *)

## Quick Reference

| When This Happens | Do This | What You Get |
|-------------------|---------|--------------|
| "I wish my agent could..." | Describe what you want | Complete skill file + setup guide |
| Need Google Calendar integration | "Read my calendar events" | Calendar reader skill |
| Want Slack notifications | "Send messages to Slack" | Slack messenger skill |
| Have CSV data to analyze | "Analyze my sales data" | CSV analyzer skill |
| Need custom API integration | "Connect to [service]" | API wrapper skill |
| Want local file processing | "Parse my PDF invoices" | File processor skill |

**Why OpenClaw-specific?** Generates skills in OpenClaw's native format, includes proper tool declarations, follows framework conventions.

---

## What This Does

Think of your OpenClaw agent as a smart assistant that can already do a lot — but sometimes you need it to do something specific to your workflow. This skill helps you teach it those new abilities.

**Real examples:**
- "I want my agent to check my Google Calendar before scheduling meetings"
- "I need it to send updates to my team's Slack channel"
- "I want it to analyze sales data from my CSV files"
- "I need it to search through my company's internal documentation"

You just describe what you want in plain English. This skill writes the code, tells you where to put it, and shows you how to test it.

**You don't need to:**
- Know how to code
- Understand APIs or technical jargon
- Deploy anything to the cloud
- Set up payment systems

---

## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **You describe what you want** — "I want my agent to read my Google Calendar"
2. **This skill asks a few questions** — "Do you have a Google Calendar API key?" "What should the output look like?"
3. **It writes the code for you** — A complete skill file ready to use
4. **It tells you exactly what to do** — "Save this file here, run this command, restart your agent"
5. **You test it** — "Show me my meetings for tomorrow"

That's it. No coding, no deployment, no complexity.

---

## How to Use This Skill

### Option 1: Through Your OpenClaw Agent (Easiest)

Just tell your agent what you want:

```
You: "I want to create a skill that reads my Google Calendar"

Agent: [Uses this skill automatically]
        "Great! I'll help you create that. A few questions:
        1. Do you have a Google Calendar API key?
        2. What information do you want from your calendar?
        3. Should it check all calendars or just your primary one?"

You: "I have an API key. I want to see my meetings for the next week. Just my primary calendar."

Agent: [Generates the skill]
        "Done! I've created a skill called 'google-calendar-reader'. 
        Here's what to do next..."
```

### Option 2: Direct API Call (For Advanced Users)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.claw0x.com/v1/call \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLAW0X_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "skill": "openclaw-skill-creator",
    "input": {
      "what_you_want": "Read my Google Calendar events",
      "why_you_need_it": "So my agent can check my schedule before booking meetings",
      "what_you_have": "Google Calendar API key"
    }
  }'
```
